    <h1>THIS IS MY DOMAIN</h1>
    <P>My name is Dua-Asare Emmanuel. I'm a fisrt year biomedical engineering student at K.N.U.S.T. 
       I'm not a very social person. I tend to keep a few friends close just for social purposes. People
       sometimes mistake this as, me being rude but I love my personal space and most of all I cherish my 
       privacy. I love to write. Writing calms me, it's so peaceful plus I can express all my
       imaginations in a much easier and detailed way.
    </P>   
    <P>I'm offering biomedical engineering at K.N.U.S.T. Many people were wondering why I selected this 
       course. Even my father was a bit skeptical and it took a little bit of convincing before he was fully 
       on board with my decision. My reason for choosing biomedical engineering is simple. 
    </P>   
    <P>I want to contribute to future technological advancements. I couldn't have chosen a better futuristic 
       and innovative course than biomedical engineering. What could be better than advancing the human body 
       through engineering. What was thought of to be impossible today could be made possible tomorrow all 
       because of innovative inventions of biomdical engineering. Through biomdical engineering artificial
       implants can be assimilated into the body for example artificial organs can be transplanted into the 
       body, implantation of artificial tissues to speed up the rate of healing or slow down the ageing process,
       , prosthetic limbs can be used by persons with disability or amputed patients also better hospital 
       equipments can be developed such as ergonomic hospital beds, dialysis machines, various types of scanning
       machines and much more. 
    </P>   
    <P>The applications for biomedical engineering seems endless. Over the years, there has been a steady increase
       in the demand for biomedical engineers. The world is changing, I hope I can make a positive impact and not
       get left behind.
    </P>
